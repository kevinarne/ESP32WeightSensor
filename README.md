# Description
To better monitor the health of my plants, I've been working on an IoT scale integrated into a planter stand. At the moment this script sends a GET request to a server.

# Next Steps
* Debug the issue causing the sensor to go offline after a few days.
* Integrate with IoTManager to add a web interface for the sensor.
* Draw up the schematic for the ESP32 and load cell wiring.
* The tare weight needs to be stored in persistent memory so it doesn't get reset every time the device is power cycled.
* Design 3D printed plant stand for standard 6" planter and post STL and STEP files.
